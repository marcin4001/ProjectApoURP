  - optionText: What can you offer me, baker?
    replyText: "Bread made from corn flour - the best in all of Arkansas. I get my
      flour from the city mills, and my loaves reach every village, even Clearwater,
      though it\u2019s outside the Republic. If you're looking for something solid,
      you\u2019ve come to the right place."

    replyText: "They\u2019re delivered by caravans protected by Baxton\u2019s gang.
      Without them, I wouldn\u2019t make it, as the trips between villages are pretty
      dangerous these days."

      but I forgot the exact recipe. Recently, I found an old notebook, and now I
      can finally try. The problem is, I need a few ingredients\u2026 Maybe you could

    replyText: "For the pizza, you\u2019ll need cheese, salami, and tomatoes. I can
      sell you the flour, so don\u2019t worry about that. Once you have the rest,
      you can bake it in my oven."

      Hmm, tastes almost like I remember. Great job! Here\u2019s 100$ for your effort.
      And now that we have it, I\u2019ll add it to my menu. Who knows, maybe all
      of Arkansas will know my pizza now!"
