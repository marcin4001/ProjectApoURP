      Research Annex. Can you give it to me?
    replyText: "Elwood Research Annex, you say? Interesting... How do you even know
      about that? I can\u2019t just give you that card. How do I know you\u2019re
      not a Soviet spy?"

    replyText: "From that little lake right in front of me. Might not be crystal
      clear, but out here, it\u2019s all about killing the thirst. You don\u2019t

    replyText: Yes, I was president before the nuclear war. Two terms. During the
      war, I hid in a bunker. When I came out, there was no country left to lead.
      I wandered until I found this oasis and started selling water.

      up a small camp. Be careful, they\u2019re armed to the teeth."
