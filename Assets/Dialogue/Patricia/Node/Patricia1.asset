    replyText: "Maybe, but the book looked like a serious report. It talked about
      research to restore dead land. I think it\u2019s worth checking out. We don\u2019t
      have much to lose."

    replyText: "I know, but it\u2019s too dangerous for both of us to go. You have
      to go alone, Thomas. Someone needs to stay and look after the place - we can\u2019t
      just leave it unattended while you\u2019re gone. I know you can do this. You\u2019re
      the only one with a chance. I believe in you."

    replyText: I think you should start looking in the village of Clearwater in the
      east. Maybe someone there knows some details.
