  description: This makeshift watering can was handcrafted from a pre-war barrel,
    welded and repurposed for watering plants in harsh conditions. Heavy and clunky,
    but it gets the job done where better tools are scarce. Rust marks and uneven
    welds tell the story of its rough, post-apocalyptic origins.
