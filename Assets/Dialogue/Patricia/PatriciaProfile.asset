  firstReply: "Hey, Thomas. How are you? I found something interesting in a pre-war
    book. It talked about the Oasis Generator, which could bring life back to dead
    lands - water, plants, everything. Maybe it\u2019s just a legend, but imagine
    how it could change our lives. Do you think it\u2019s possible?"
  secReply: Hey, Thomas. How are you doing?
