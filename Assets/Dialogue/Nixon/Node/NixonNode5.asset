  - optionText: The device is missing a sample of wheat and a car battery.
    replyText: No problem. The Republic will help you get them. But you need to understand
      something - you cannot use this device on your own, you would only waste its
      potential. If you hand it over to the Republic, we will give you and your girlfriend
      a home in the capital. What do you think about that?
