    replyText: "Before the war, I worked in a research lab studying alpha, beta,
      and gamma radiation. After everything collapsed, I was one of the few who knew
      how to handle it. That\u2019s why I know how to treat people."

      a lab."
    replyText: "This is my small lab. I prepare a stronger version of Radkiller here,
      one that heals more effectively when dealing with higher doses of radiation.
      The regular Radkiller doesn\u2019t heal as much from larger doses as mine does."

    replyText: Yes, I can sell you the right medicine. I have Healthpak, regular
      Radkiller, or an upgraded version that heals higher doses of radiation.

      the book] Here it is! Mixing a Healthpak with a Radkiller stops the zombie
      transformation. Here\u2019s $300 for your trouble - that\u2019s what this book
      is currently worth on the market, as far as I know."
