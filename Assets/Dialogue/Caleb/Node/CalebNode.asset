  - optionText: "Looks like you\u2019ve got a lot of work here. How are you managing?"
    replyText: "Barely. Corn needs water, and my watering can\u2019s falling apart.
      Most of it leaks out before I even reach the field. Every day\u2019s a fight
      against weeds, heat, and busted tools. It\u2019s not easy, but at least my
      wife makes sure there\u2019s always a meal waiting for me at home. That\u2019s
      something, I guess."

  - optionText: What do you do with all the corn you grow?
    replyText: My corn goes to the mill in Pinehill. They grind it into flour, and
      the bakery next door makes bread. But the road there is always a gamble - bandits
      or a broken wagon can delay everything. Luckily, they pay well once I deliver
      the goods.

  - optionText: Do you have any problems I could help with?
    replyText: "Actually, yes. My watering can\u2019s completely useless now - it
      leaks like a sieve. Without it, my corn\u2019s going to dry out. If you\u2019re
      ever in Clearwater, maybe you can find me a new one. Tools like that are hard
      to come by these days. It\u2019d make a big difference."

  - optionText: Remind me again - where do I find that watering can?
    replyText: In Clearwater. If you find one, bring it back. I really need it for
      my crops.

    replyText: "No way\u2026 You actually found one? I was starting to think my cornfield
      was done for. This\u2019ll help more than you know. Here, take the 80 bucks
      I promised. You earned it."
