      military base? I need to know, because that base is on my territory, in the
      Republic of Arkansas. So I ask again\u2026 what were you doing there?"

    replyText: "That\u2019s easy to find. You can probably find one in an old car
      somewhere. Look around parking lots, outside stores or restaurants - you should
      find a charged one."

  - optionText: Where can I find a wheat sample?
    replyText: "That is a tougher matter. The last supplies, as I\u2019ve heard,
      are in a government bunker, but it is on the property of a farmer named Archi.
      You\u2019ll have to convince him to give you access - he\u2019s a very stubborn
      man. He lives to the northeast of Silverton, it should be easy to find him."

    replyText: I know many things about you. I have my informants spread across the
      Republic. Think about it - how else would I know you entered the military base?

  - optionText: Why did the Republic of Arkansas break away from the United States?
    replyText: After the nuclear war, the United States ceased to exist as a single
      nation. Each state went its own way, and now there are 50 independent countries,
      each fighting to survive. We created the Republic of Arkansas to survive and
      rebuild what we could. Now, we decide our own future.

  - optionText: What can you tell me about the Black Eagles?
    replyText: The Black Eagles are the ones responsible for my safety and maintaining
      order in the Republic. Officially, they answer to me, but in practice, Baxton
      leads them. He keeps them in line with a firm hand, which makes them effective.
      If you want to know more, talk to him.
