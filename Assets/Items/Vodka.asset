  description: "Purnoff is a pre-war vodka produced in Finland, known for its simple
    recipe and high alcohol content. Before the collapse, it was a cheap and widely
    available drink, often chosen by those who didn\u2019t care about taste. Now,
    bottles of it can still be found in abandoned stores and shelters. Restores 2
    health points."
