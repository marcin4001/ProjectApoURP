  - optionText: What can you tell me about Pinehill?
    replyText: "It\u2019s a quiet village in the middle of the desert. We\u2019ve
      got two mills that provide flour for our baker, Jonas. There\u2019s also Thomas\u2019
      gym and Travis\u2019 gun store. We\u2019re not a big settlement, but we have
      everything we need to live."

  - optionText: How did you become the leader of this village?
    replyText: I became the leader by chance. I found some pre-war ruins, fixed them
      up, and built the mills. Soon, other people started coming and setting up their
      own businesses. I made a deal with President Nixon, who accepted us into the
      Republic of Arkansas and sent guards to protect us.

    replyText: "That\u2019s the President of Arkansas, the current ruler. He was
      elected two years ago, and he has a big influence on how our republic develops."

  - optionText: Where can I find a floppy disk?
    replyText: "Try the old relay tower northeast of Pinehill. You might find a blank
      floppy disk there. Or, if you don\u2019t want to search dangerous places, maybe
      from one of the scavengers."

  - optionText: Why can't you use paper to write the list?
    replyText: "That\u2019s the agreement with the President. He prefers using a
      floppy disk reader rather than reading from paper. Generally, this is how we
      transfer information in the Republic."

      and don\u2019t lose it on the way!"
