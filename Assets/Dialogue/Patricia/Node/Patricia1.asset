      research to restore dead land. I think it\u2019s worth checking out. We don\u2019t

      mention the location, but I heard that a village called Clearwater was founded

    replyText: "I know, but it\u2019s too dangerous for both of us to go. You have
      to go alone, Revo. Someone needs to stay here and take care of everything while
      you\u2019re gone. I know you can do this. You\u2019re the only one with a chance.
      I believe in you."
