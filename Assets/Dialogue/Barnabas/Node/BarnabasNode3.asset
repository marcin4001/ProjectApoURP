  - optionText: What do you know about the Oasis Generator?
    replyText: I once read a book that had the blueprint for such a generator and
      the location where you might find a working one. That book is in the library
      in Evergreen City, south of here. If you truly want to find the Oasis Generator,
      I suggest starting there.

  - optionText: Where exactly is Evergreen City?
    replyText: "Evergreen City is south of here, in the middle of the desert. It\u2019s
      a fairly large city that stands out against the barren desert landscape. Stick
      to the main trail, and you\u2019ll eventually reach it. But be careful\u2014these
      lands are full of mutated animals. It\u2019s best to be prepared for anything."

  - optionText: What do you know about Evergreen City?
    replyText: "It\u2019s the capital of the Republic of Free Arkansas, twice the
      size of Clearwater. It\u2019s full of traders, craftsmen, and people from all
      over the wasteland. The city is bustling with life. If you get there, contact
      Marcus Reed, their leader. He\u2019s someone who might be able to help you."
