      me, first bring me a can of pre-war coffee. A traveling merchant tested me
      with one not long ago - been craving it ever since. When you bring me the can,
      then we\u2019ll talk."

      before the war my mom did the shopping at the FoodMart in Little Rock. Maybe
      that store\u2019s still standing."
