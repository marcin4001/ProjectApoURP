  - optionText: What can you tell me about Pinehill?
    replyText: "It\u2019s a quiet village in the middle of the desert. We\u2019ve
      got two mills that provide flour for our baker, Jonas. There\u2019s also Thomas\u2019
      gym and Travis\u2019 gun store. We\u2019re not a big settlement, but we have
      everything we need to live."

  - optionText: How did you become the leader of this village?
    replyText: I became the leader by chance. I found some pre-war ruins, fixed them
      up, and built the mills. Soon, other people started coming and setting up their
      own businesses. I made a deal with President Nixon, who accepted us into the
      Republic of Arkansas and sent guards to protect us.

      have any blank floppy disks to write it on. If you can get me one, I\u2019ll
      give you the list."
