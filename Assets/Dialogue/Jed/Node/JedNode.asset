  - optionText: Why Hawaiian shirts, of all things?
    replyText: "I\u2019m from Hawaii. In my home village, everyone wears shirts like
      these. When I came to Arkansas, I saw people dressed all dull and gray. I figured
      it was time to bring in some color. That\u2019s how my shop got started."

  - optionText: Do many folks in Silverton buy this kind of stuff?
    replyText: Yeah, pretty much everyone in the village wears one of my shirts.
      Well, except for Father Adam, Benny - the Ratburger guy, and Dr. Harlan. Thanks
      to me, Silverton is one of the most colorful places in the wasteland.
