  - optionText: How did this village come to be?

  - optionText: Can I go deeper into the city ruins?
    replyText: "No, there\u2019s still terrible radiation there. Many soldiers never
      came back from that place, so we put up sheet metal fences near the skyscrapers."

    replyText: "Actually\u2026 yes. Strange noises have been coming from the old
      supermarket east of the village for a few days. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s
      people or some kind of mutated creatures, but it could be a threat to the village.
      Could you go there and check it out?"

    replyText: "Good job. I was afraid it was something more serious, but since it
      was just rats, it\u2019s great you got rid of them. The whole village can sleep
      easier. Here\u2019s your reward \u2013 250 dollars, you\u2019ve earned it"

      water.
    replyText: "That\u2019s very kind of him, but we zombies don\u2019t need clean
      water. We drink dirty water and it doesn\u2019t affect us. You can pass that
      on to Martin."
