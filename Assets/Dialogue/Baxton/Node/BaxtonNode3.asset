    replyText: "We protect the farmers, caravans heading to Pinehill, and ensure
      that this city runs the way it should. Without us, this region would\u2019ve
      fallen apart. Two years ago, we helped the president take power and restore
      order."

    replyText: "Yes, I\u2019ve got something for you. My men lost a valuable radio
      transmitter - a tool that would allow us to stay in contact with other settlements.
      Start by talking to the Black Eagles at the bar. They might know what happened
      to it."

    replyText: "Go talk to the Black Eagles at the bar. They were the last ones to
      have it, so they might know where it ended up. If anyone has a clue, it\u2019s
      them."

      to get it back.
    replyText: "Figures. That bastard would sell his own boots for a drink. But you
      got it back, and that\u2019s what matters. Here\u2019s 150 dollars - consider
      it a little extra for your trouble."

    replyText: Yes, there is one more job. A military camp in the former state of
      Mississippi worries me. It is close to the border of our republic. I want you
      to go there and find out why they are stationed there. Make sure you are well
      armed. It is far to the southeast.
