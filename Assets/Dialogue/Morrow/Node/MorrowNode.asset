  options:
  - optionText: How did this village come to be?
    replyText: The village was founded in 2110 on the site of a survivor camp built
      by soldiers. All the zombies who were here helped build it. Nothing has changed
      since 2110.

  - optionText: Are there any non-zombies living in the village?
    replyText: No, this village is only for zombies who survived Little Rock. Basically,
      everyone who made it ended up a zombie. There was no chance to avoid it - the
      bomb hit the city center directly.

  - optionText: Is there anything interesting to see here?
    replyText: "Not really. There\u2019s just my house, Private Ryan\u2019s house,
      a zombie dormitory and the cafeteria. As you can see - nothing exciting."

  - optionText: Can I go deeper into the city ruins?
    replyText: "No, there\u2019s still terrible radiation there. Many soldiers never
      came back from that place, so we put up sheet metal fences near the skyscrapers."
