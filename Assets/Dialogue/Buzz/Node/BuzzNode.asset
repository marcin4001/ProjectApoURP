    replyText: "I live here and raise two cows I inherited from my father. \nI sell
      the milk I get from them to nearby villages of the Arkansas Republic. The cows
      are the only thing keeping me out here. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve moved to
      one of the villages long ago."

    replyText: Good eye. I get some decent benefits from it. The Republic supplies
      me with cattle feed and drinking water, and in return I provide them with milk.

      activated and just buried itself in the ground. It\u2019s nothing but trouble.
      Baxton won\u2019t send a guard because he\u2019s afraid it might explode someday.
      If someone could disarm it, I\u2019d be forever grateful."
