  - optionText: Why did the Republic of Arkansas break away from the United States?
    replyText: After the nuclear war, the United States ceased to exist as a single
      nation. Each state went its own way, and now there are 50 independent countries,
      each fighting to survive. We created the Republic of Arkansas to survive and
      rebuild what we could. Now, we decide our own future.

  - optionText: What can you tell me about the Black Eagles?
    replyText: The Black Eagles are the ones responsible for my safety and maintaining
      order in the Republic. Officially, they answer to me, but in practice, Baxton
      leads them. He keeps them in line with a firm hand, which makes them effective.
      If you want to know more, talk to him.

  - optionText: Can I access the library?
    replyText: "The library is one of the most important places in the Republic.
      It holds all the preserved knowledge from before the war. But I don\u2019t
      know you yet, so I can\u2019t allow a stranger access to it. If you want to
      use it, you\u2019ll have to do something for the Republic first. Prove you
      can be trusted."

    replyText: "Yes, there\u2019s something you can take care of. Go to Pinehill
      and talk to their leader, Mark Caldwell. Ask him for a list of supplies they
      need, on my behalf. This list will help us organize better deliveries and improve
      our strained relations with Pinehill."

    replyText: "I\u2019d like you to go to Pinehill and speak with Mark Caldwell.
      Ask him for a list of supplies they need - tell him you\u2019re acting on my
      behalf. That list will help us plan better deliveries and improve our relations
      with them."
