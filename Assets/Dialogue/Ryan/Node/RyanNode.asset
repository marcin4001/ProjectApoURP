  - optionText: How did you end up here?
    replyText: I came from one of the bases to rescue survivors from Little Rock.
      At first, there was a survivor camp here, then we rebuilt it into a village.
      Before the war, I fought communists, before the atomic bombs dropped. Now I
      am a zombie - just like the rest of the survivors.

  - optionText: Do you even remember what that war was about?
    replyText: I don't really remember. It was probably about resources. For a few
      years, our guys were fighting the Soviets, and then they blew the whole damn
      world up with nukes.
