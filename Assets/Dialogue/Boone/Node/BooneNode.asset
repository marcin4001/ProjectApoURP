  - optionText: What are you doing out in the wastelands?
    replyText: "I used to live in Evergreen City, but I couldn't sit still. I started
      wandering the wastelands, looking for all sorts of stuff. Eventually, I came
      across this old rusty camper and decided to settle down here. This is where
      I store everything I\u2019ve managed to scavenge."

      of political slogan, but I\u2019m not sure."
