  - optionText: What kind of work do you do?
    replyText: "I\u2019m a cattle rancher. The meat feeds the townsfolk, and I make
      sausage from the rest. The problem is, the pastures east of the city have been
      overrun by goldraxes - giant, golden, shell-covered beasts. And I have to pay
      the Black Eagles for protection, or doing business would be even harder."

    replyText: "I\u2019ve got some sausage, but it\u2019s not cheap. The goldraxes
      are blocking the pastures, so my cattle can\u2019t graze. On top of that, I
      have to pay the Black Eagles for protection, because no one else will keep
      me safe. If you\u2019ve got dollars, I can sell you something, but it won\u2019t
      come cheap."

    replyText: "Help? If you\u2019ve got the guts, you could deal with those goldraxes.
      They\u2019re giant, golden beasts that have taken over the pastures east of
      the city. Anyone who\u2019s tried to drive them off hasn\u2019t come back.
      If you can kill them, I\u2019ll be able to graze my herd again. You\u2019d
      help us all."

    replyText: "The pastures are east of the city, just past the old highway. You\u2019ll
      spot the fields of grass and a few fences once you cross it. That\u2019s where
      the hellish goldraxes are."

    replyText: "No kidding? Damn, that\u2019s a relief. My cattle will finally have
      a place to graze again. You did us all a huge favor - here, take this. 100
      dollars might not be much, but it\u2019s what I can spare. You earned it."
