  - optionText: Barnabas told me about the library there, and I want to use it.
    replyText: "If he told you, that means he trusts you. It\u2019s not easy to gain
      his trust, not many people know about that library. That\u2019s a good reason.
      Here\u2019s your pass. Give it to the gatekeeper, he\u2019ll let you in."

      been having serious issues with the poor stealing crops and other goods. Because
      of that, they haven\u2019t been letting outsiders in. If you have a better
      reason, come back to me."
