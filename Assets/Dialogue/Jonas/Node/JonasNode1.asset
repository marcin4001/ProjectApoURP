  - optionText: What can you offer me, baker?
    replyText: "Bread made from corn flour - the best in all of Arkansas. I get my
      flour from the city mills, and my loaves reach every village, even Clearwater,
      though it\u2019s outside the Republic. If you're looking for something solid,
      you\u2019ve come to the right place."

  - optionText: Who delivers your baked goods?
    replyText: "They\u2019re delivered by caravans protected by Baxton\u2019s gang.
      Without them, I wouldn\u2019t make it, as the trips between villages are pretty
      dangerous these days."
