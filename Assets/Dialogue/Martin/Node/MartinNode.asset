  - optionText: How did you manage to found Silverton?
    replyText: "The story starts in Clearwater, when I didn\u2019t have a job. I
      found a water source south of Arkansas and started selling water to villages.
      I made enough to build the first buildings and rented them to traders. That\u2019s
      how the settlement grew and people started coming."

      guards Baxton sent can\u2019t handle them. Don\u2019t even think about heading
      out there - their camp\u2019s west of here and they\u2019re real dangerous."

      with the sentient zombies from the Little Rock ruins to the northeast. They
