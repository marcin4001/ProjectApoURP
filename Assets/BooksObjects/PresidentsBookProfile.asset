  - text: "Harry S. Truman (1945\u20131953)\n\nParty: Democratic\nHarry S. Truman
      assumed the presidency after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt at one of the
      most critical moments in U.S. history. He authorized the use of atomic weapons
      against Japan, bringing World War II to an end. In the postwar years, he focused
      on rebuilding Western Europe through the Marshall Plan, strengthening America\u2019s
      global influence. He introduced the Truman Doctrine, which became a foundation
      of U.S. foreign policy toward the Soviet Union. His presidency marked the beginning
      of a prolonged rivalry between the two superpowers."
  - text: "Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953\u20131961)\n\nParty: Republican\nDwight D.
      Eisenhower was a highly respected general and Supreme Commander of Allied forces
      in Europe during World War II. As president, he brought military discipline
      and pragmatism to civilian leadership. He emphasized economic stability and
      oversaw major infrastructure projects, most notably the Interstate Highway
      System. In foreign policy, he relied on nuclear deterrence and the maintenance
      of a balance of power. His presidency is often associated with stability and
      economic growth."
  - text: "John F. Kennedy (1961\u20131963)\n\nParty: Democratic\nJohn F. Kennedy
      was one of the youngest presidents in U.S. history and a symbol of a new generation
      of leadership. His presidency took place during a period of intense international
      tension and rapid social change. He was assassinated on November 22, 1963,
      in Dallas, Texas, while traveling in a presidential motorcade. Lee Harvey Oswald
      was accused of the assassination but was shot and killed two days later by
      Jack Ruby before standing trial. The circumstances of the assassination remain
      the subject of ongoing debate. His image appears on the 100-dollar bill."
  - text: "Lyndon B. Johnson (1963\u20131969)\n\nParty: Democratic\nLyndon B. Johnson
      assumed office following Kennedy\u2019s assassination and quickly established
      himself as a powerful political leader. He launched an ambitious set of domestic
      reforms known as the \u201CGreat Society.\u201D These reforms expanded civil
      rights protections and significantly increased federal social programs. At
      the same time, his presidency was marked by a major escalation of the Vietnam
      War. The conflict triggered widespread protests and deep divisions within American
      society."
  - text: "Richard Nixon (1969\u20131974)\n\nParty: Republican\nRichard Nixon pursued
      an active and pragmatic foreign policy during the Cold War. He normalized relations
      with the People\u2019s Republic of China and signed arms limitation agreements
      with the Soviet Union. Nixon also oversaw the end of direct U.S. military involvement
      in the Vietnam War. His presidency, however, was overshadowed by the Watergate
      scandal. As a result, he became the first U.S. president to resign from office."
  - text: "Gerald Ford (1974\u20131977)\n\nParty: Republican\nGerald Ford assumed
      the presidency after Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation during a severe political
      crisis. He was the only U.S. president never elected as either president or
      vice president. His most controversial decision was granting a full pardon
      to Nixon, intended to bring national healing. The move was widely criticized
      and damaged his public support. Ford\u2019s presidency focused on restoring
      trust in government institutions."
  - text: "Jimmy Carter (1977\u20131981)\n\nParty: Democratic\nJimmy Carter emphasized
      ethics, human rights, and diplomacy in both domestic and foreign policy. His
      greatest diplomatic achievement was the Camp David Accords between Egypt and
      Israel. Domestically, his administration struggled with high inflation and
      an energy crisis. His presidency was further weakened by the Iran hostage crisis.
      These challenges significantly undermined his political standing."
  - text: "Ronald Reagan (1981\u20131989)\n\nParty: Republican\nRonald Reagan was
      one of the most distinctive figures in late twentieth-century American politics.
      A former actor, he was known for his communication skills and strong public
      image. He implemented economic reforms based on tax cuts and market deregulation.
      Reagan significantly increased defense spending and expanded U.S. military
      capabilities. His presidency reinforced the perception of American strength
      and global influence."
  - text: "George H. W. Bush (1989\u20131993)\n\nParty: Republican\nGeorge H. W.
      Bush was an experienced politician and diplomat who had previously served as
      vice president and Director of Central Intelligence. He assumed office during
      a period of major international tension and change. The defining event of his
      presidency was the Gulf War. Bush led a broad international coalition, demonstrating
      U.S. military and diplomatic leadership. His governing style emphasized alliances
      and pragmatic diplomacy."
