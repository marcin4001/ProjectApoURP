  - text: "Player stats\n\nPlayer stats describe the hero\u2019s core abilities and
      have a direct impact on combat, exploration, and how challenges are solved.\n\nStrength
      represents physical endurance and melee combat ability. It affects maximum
      health points, damage dealt with fists and melee weapons, and the ability to
      handle heavy objects. High Strength increases survivability and effectiveness
      in close combat.\n\nDexterity represents reflexes and physical agility. It
      affects the chance to dodge incoming attacks and the ability to open mechanical
      locks using lockpicks. High Dexterity allows the character to avoid damage
      more effectively and react faster in combat situations."
  - text: 'Perception represents awareness and precision. It affects the chance to
      hit with firearms as well as the chance to land critical hits that deal increased
      damage. High Perception allows the character to strike targets more accurately
      and deal powerful, precise attacks more often.


      Technical represents
      technical knowledge and the ability to operate devices. It affects the chance
      to successfully repair equipment, recover parts from damaged machines, open
      electronic and code-locked doors, and access special technical dialogue options.'
