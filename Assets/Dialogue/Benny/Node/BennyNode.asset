  - optionText: What exactly are these Ratburgers made of?
    replyText: I make them from local rats that roam the wasteland. I hunt them myself.
      For the Ratburgers, I add fresh tomato and some good cheddar cheese. Tastes
      damn good!

      to better meat and serves decent meals I can't afford. People prefer his food
      over my Ratburgers. I\u2019m starting to wonder how much longer I\u2019ll last

      If you find a sauce, bring it to me - I\u2019ll give you an M10 Submachine
      Gun and some ammo."
