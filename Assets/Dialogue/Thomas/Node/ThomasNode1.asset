  - optionText: How long have you been running this gym?
    replyText: I started it about two years ago. After the war, it was tough to get
      decent training equipment. I worked so hard to get it that I lost all my hair!
      But in the end, I made it, and now anyone in the state can come train here.

  - optionText: Who trains here mostly?
    replyText: "I\u2019ve got two regulars - Dwayne \u2018Ironfist\u2019 Cole and
      Derek \u2018Bulldozer\u2019 Shaw. Tough guys, both of them, put their heart
      into training. Other than that, some travelers stop by, but not too many. Most
      people would rather avoid a fight than prepare for one."

  - optionText: Can I help you find new clients somehow?
    replyText: "Honestly, yes. It\u2019s hard to reach new people - most prefer to
      lay low or avoid fights. If you can, put up these posters in a few towns. One
      in Clearwater, another in Evergreen City, and a third in Silverton. Maybe that\u2019ll
      get someone interested enough to check out my gym."

  - optionText: Where exactly was I supposed to put up those posters?
    replyText: In Clearwater, Evergreen City, and Silverton. More places, more people
      - maybe someone will finally take an interest in training.

      you - a pre-war Jager Lord. Found it in a wreck years ago. Strong, herbal\u2026
      rare stuff. Take it."
