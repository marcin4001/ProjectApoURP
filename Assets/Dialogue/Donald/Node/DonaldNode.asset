      Research Annex. Can you give it to me?

      about that? I can\u2019t just give you that card. How do I know you\u2019re
      not a Soviet spy?"

    replyText: Yes, I was president before the nuclear war. Two terms. During the
      war, I hid in a bunker. When I came out, there was no country left to lead.
      I wandered until I found this oasis and started selling water.
