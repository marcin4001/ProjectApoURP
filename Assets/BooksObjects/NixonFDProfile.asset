      Elder Barnabas,\r\n\r\nIn these challenging times, unity is our greatest strength.
      The administration of Evergreen City proposes to establish a formal alliance
      with Clearwater to enhance mutual security, share resources, and rebuild our
      communities together.\r\n\r\nThis cooperation would include:\r\n\r- Joint patrols
      against bandits and raiders\r\n\r- Exchange of food and medical supplies\r\n\r-
      Shared access to technical knowledge and archives\r\n\r\nWe believe that by
      working together, our settlements can thrive despite the hardships.\r\n\r"
  - text: "\rWe kindly ask you to consider this proposal as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nPresident
      Nixon"
