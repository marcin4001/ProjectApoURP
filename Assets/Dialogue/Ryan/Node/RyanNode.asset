  - optionText: Did you work at Elwood Research Annex?
    replyText: "Yeah, I did. I was just a regular soldier there, guarding the scientists.
      Funny you know about that classified place, but whatever \u2013 war's over,
      USA's gone. Why are you asking?"

      seen this one already\u2026 The tape looks old, but maybe it still works. Will
      you wait while I check?"

  - optionText: How did you end up here?
    replyText: I came from one of the bases to rescue survivors from Little Rock.
      At first, there was a survivor camp here, then we rebuilt it into a village.
      Before the war, I fought communists, before the atomic bombs dropped. Now I
      am a zombie - just like the rest of the survivors.

  - optionText: Do you even remember what that war was about?
    replyText: I don't really remember. It was probably about resources. For a few
      years, our guys were fighting the Soviets, and then they blew the whole damn
      world up with nukes.

    replyText: "Yeah. A few days ago I found an old TV. There\u2019s no signal anymore
      - all gone after the war. But it\u2019s got a VHS player. If you find any movie
      tape out there, bring it to me. I\u2019ll reward you with some AK ammo - 7.62
      mm."

  - optionText: Where exactly should I look for the old president?
    replyText: In the state of Mississippi. Just head straight east. If the rumors
      I heard are true, he should be somewhere near an oasis out there.
