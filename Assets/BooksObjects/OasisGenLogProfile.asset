  - text: "2097-05-20\n23:18 hours\n\nThis is probably the most important day of
      my life. I\u2019ve finally managed to create the Oasis Generator prototype.\nIf
      the world really collapses in nuclear fire, this device will give people a
      chance. On the scorched, radioactive wasteland, it will be possible to recreate
      small green enclaves \u2013 places where life can sprout again. This means
      civilization could recover much faster than we currently assume.\n\nI\u2019m
      only missing two elements: a power source and suitable seeds.\nThe power source
      doesn\u2019t need to be complicated \u2013 after the war, car batteries will
      literally be everywhere, in the wrecks of abandoned vehicles. This is a perfect,
      easily accessible solution."
  - text: "As for seeds, the best option would be modified wheat, resistant and fast-growing.
      I\u2019m sure it can be found somewhere. The grains just need to be placed
      in special containers \u2013 I have a few empty ones in the cabinet nearby,
      they fit perfectly with the generator.\n\nFor now, I\u2019ll close my eyes.
      Tomorrow I\u2019ll ask one of the soldiers to go and fetch the seeds for me.\nAnd
      after that, we\u2019ll run the first test of my invention."
