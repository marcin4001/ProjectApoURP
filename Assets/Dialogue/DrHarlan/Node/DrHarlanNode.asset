    replyText: "Before the war, I worked in a research lab studying alpha, beta,
      and gamma radiation. After everything collapsed, I was one of the few who knew
      how to handle it. That\u2019s why I know how to treat people."

      a lab."
    replyText: "This is my small lab. I prepare a stronger version of Radkiller here,
      one that heals more effectively when dealing with higher doses of radiation.
      The regular Radkiller doesn\u2019t heal as much from larger doses as mine does."
