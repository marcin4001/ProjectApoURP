  - text: "Fort Dustwalker\nLocation: Nevada\n\nSet amid the vast, wind-swept flats
      of central Nevada, Fort Dustwalker was a quiet but persistent presence in the
      region\u2019s arid expanse. Its primary functions were never formally stated,
      though its infrastructure hinted at long-term operations and minimal dependency
      on external supply lines. Personnel assigned here often underwent lengthy rotations
      and reported a unique blend of isolation and discipline. Dustwalker was not
      frequently mentioned in official communiqu\xE9s, nor was it commonly marked
      on military route maps, giving rise to the informal nickname \u201CThe Whispering
      Fort.\u201D The surrounding area remains undeveloped to this day.\n\nCoordinates:

  - text: "Camp Saberline\nLocation: Texas\n\nLocated on the outer edges of western
      Texas plains, Camp Saberline served as a rotational training post with a reputation
      for speed, structure, and adaptability. While outwardly modest, its internal
      design allowed for quick mobilization and multi-unit accommodation. Activity
      within the camp was frequent but discreet, with few public mentions beyond
      vague references to \u201Cjoint preparedness programs.\u201D Saberline\u2019s
      personnel were noted for operating under tight turnover schedules, suggesting
      the base was more dynamic than it appeared. Observers often remarked on the
      curious absence of signage and its nearly invisible footprint from ground-level
      approach.\n\nCoordinates: 32.3982\xB0 N, 100.0915\xB0 W"
  - text: "Elwood Research Annex\nLocation: Arkansas\n\nHidden beyond tree-covered
      hills east of Fountain Hill, the Elwood Annex appeared on few official maps
      and was seldom referenced outside agricultural circles. Officially tied to
      sustainable development projects, the site maintained a low but consistent
      level of activity. Some declassified memos hinted at simulations aimed at post-crisis
      environmental recovery, including work on an experimental \"Oasis Generator\"
      - a project said to potentially restore plant life after large-scale devastation.
      Access was restricted, and locals often speculated about \u201Csilent shipments\u201D
      moving in during off-hours.\n\nCoordinates: 33.3075\xB0 N, 91.8322\xB0 W"
