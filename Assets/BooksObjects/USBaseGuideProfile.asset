      of central Nevada, Fort Dustwalker was a quiet but persistent presence in the
      region\u2019s arid expanse. Its primary functions were never formally stated,
      though its infrastructure hinted at long-term operations and minimal dependency
      on external supply lines. Personnel assigned here often underwent lengthy rotations
      and reported a unique blend of isolation and discipline. Dustwalker was not
      frequently mentioned in official communiqu\xE9s, nor was it commonly marked
      on military route maps, giving rise to the informal nickname \u201CThe Whispering
      Fort.\u201D The surrounding area remains undeveloped to this day.\n\nCoordinates:

  - text: "Camp Saberline\nLocation: Texas\n\nLocated on the outer edges of western
      Texas plains, Camp Saberline served as a rotational training post with a reputation
      for speed, structure, and adaptability. While outwardly modest, its internal
      design allowed for quick mobilization and multi-unit accommodation. Activity
      within the camp was frequent but discreet, with few public mentions beyond
      vague references to \u201Cjoint preparedness programs.\u201D Saberline\u2019s
      personnel were noted for operating under tight turnover schedules, suggesting
      the base was more dynamic than it appeared. Observers often remarked on the
      curious absence of signage and its nearly invisible footprint from ground-level
      approach.\n\nCoordinates: 32.3982\xB0 N, 100.0915\xB0 W"
  - text: "Elwood Research Annex\nLocation: Arkansas\n\nHidden in a forested canyon
      just south of Parkdale, the Elwood Annex appeared on few official maps and
      was seldom referenced outside agricultural circles. Officially associated with
      sustainable development projects, the facility maintained a low but steady
      operational profile. Some declassified memos hinted at environmental simulations
      and contingency strategies for post-crisis recovery - most notably, experimental
      work on a so-called \"Oasis Generator,\" a system rumored to be capable of
      restoring plant life after catastrophic events. Access remained highly restricted,
      and nearby residents often remarked on the arrival of \u201Csilent shipments\u201D
      under cover of night.\n\nCoordinates: 33.0632\xB0 N, 91.5782\xB0 W"
