      that this city runs the way it should. Without us, this region would\u2019ve
      fallen apart. Two years ago, we helped the president take power and restore
      order."

      transmitter - a tool that would allow us to stay in contact with other settlements.
      Start by talking to the Black Eagles at the bar. They might know what happened
      to it."

      got it back, and that\u2019s what matters. Here\u2019s 150 dollars - consider
      it a little extra for your trouble."
