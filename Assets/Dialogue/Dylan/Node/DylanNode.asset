    replyText: "I left Silverton down south, heading to my brother in Missouri. On
      the way through Clearwater, I ran out of fuel. I didn\u2019t feel too good
      in the town I was in before - bandits from Louisiana kept attacking. And that\u2019s
      how I ended up stuck here."

      my place in Silverton. As for the fuel, I heard there\u2019s an old gas station
      to the east of here - maybe there\u2019s still something left."
