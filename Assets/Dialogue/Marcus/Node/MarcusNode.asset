      I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s one at the junkyard south of the village. It\u2019s
      a dangerous place, but if you could retrieve it, it would be a great help to

    replyText: "The junkyard is an old, abandoned place. It\u2019s full of dangerous
      traps and wild creatures that have made it their home. Watch out for sharp
      metal debris \u2014 rusty scraps can easily hide lurking threats. If you're
      lucky, you might find something valuable, but stay alert."
