  - optionText: What do you know about the Oasis Generator?
    replyText: I once read a book that had the blueprint for such a generator and
      the location where you might find a working one. That book is in the library
      in Evergreen City, southwest of here. If you truly want to find the Oasis Generator,
      I suggest starting there.

  - optionText: Where exactly is Evergreen City?
    replyText: "Evergreen City is southwest of here, in the middle of the desert.
      It\u2019s a fairly large city that stands out against the barren desert landscape.
      Stick to the main trail, and you\u2019ll eventually reach it. But be careful\u2014these
      lands are full of mutated animals. It\u2019s best to be prepared for anything."

  - optionText: What do you know about Evergreen City?
    replyText: "It\u2019s the capital of the Republic of Free Arkansas, twice the
      size of Clearwater. It\u2019s full of farmers, and there\u2019s a bar that
      serves as a stop for travelers. The city is bustling with life. If you get
      there, contact President Nixon. He\u2019s someone who might be able to help
      you."

    replyText: Hmm... a cooperation proposal from President Nixon? Interesting...
      [inserts the floppy disk into the device and reads in silence for a moment]...
      Very intriguing. Tell him I'll respond in a month - I need to think it over.
