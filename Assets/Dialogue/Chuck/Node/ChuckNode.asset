    replyText: "The soup\u2019s made of noodles, carrots, and dirty water. Unfortunately,
      even though I call it chicken soup, there\u2019s no chicken in it - I can\u2019t
      afford to add any. Other zombies don\u2019t mind."

  - optionText: Do you have anything else on the menu?
    replyText: No. This is a cafeteria for poor zombies, not a restaurant. You either
      buy the soup, or go somewhere else.

  - optionText: How long have you been running this cafeteria?
    replyText: "Since 2110, when the survivor camp turned into a zombie village.
      So, quite a while. I figured zombies need to eat too, so I started it \u2013
      since I\u2019m a zombie myself."
