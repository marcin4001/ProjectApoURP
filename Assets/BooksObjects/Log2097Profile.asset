  - text: "2097-05-22\n19:28 - Oklahoma / Arkansas border\n\nWe\u2019ve reached the
      state line. The roads are torn apart, the ground covered in ash, and the air
      feels heavy, like before a storm. The Shermans crawl forward, but no one dares
      to stop - orders are orders.\n\nThe radiation meters are going crazy, their
      needles twitching without pattern. We can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s just interference
      or if we\u2019ve already crossed into the fallout zone. Everyone keeps checking
      their hands, their faces - looking for the first signs. We don\u2019t know
      if we\u2019re already getting radiation sickness.\n\nThere\u2019s a faint glow
      on the horizon to the east. That must be Little Rock - or what\u2019s left
      of it."
