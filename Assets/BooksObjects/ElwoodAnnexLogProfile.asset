  - text: "2097-05-23\n\n05:42 hours\n\nWe're moving toward Little Rock. The city
      took a direct hit, but according to the last emergency transmissions before
      the networks collapsed, there may still be survivors - likely in underground
      structures. Command gave the order: our unit is to make the push and provide
      assistance.\n\nAll access cards to Elwood Research Annex have been secured
      and taken by technical personnel. Nothing is being left behind. Systems in
      Sectors 7 through 10 must not fall into the wrong hands - even now.\n\nHard
      to measure the full extent of the damage. The sky\u2019s still dark, radiation
      levels are high, and our recon drones lose signal every few klicks."
  - text: "Moving along the old roads will be dangerous, but we have no alternative.\n\nThey
      say this isn\u2019t over yet. But if there\u2019s anyone alive in Little Rock,
      we have a duty to find them."
