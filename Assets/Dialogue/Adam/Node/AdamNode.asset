  - optionText: Who was Saint Sylvester?
    replyText: He was a humble man who lived in the forests before the war. He owned
      nothing but a walking stick and a hooded robe. He sought only peace and clarity
      of spirit. We follow his example in these broken times.

  - optionText: Why is Saint Sylvester the patron of this church?
    replyText: "It happened by chance - or perhaps by divine will. During the nuclear
      war, a small church nearby was destroyed by fire. Only a statue of Saint Sylvester
      and a book about his life survived. Nothing else. I took it as a sign. That\u2019s
      why his church stands here now."

      - Orthodox, Catholic, or anyone seeking peace."

      the old world.
