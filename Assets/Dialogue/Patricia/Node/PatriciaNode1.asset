      heard the noise, but before I could do anything, it was already over. They
      weren\u2019t ordinary wolves; they looked starving, like they\u2019d been hunting
      for weeks."

    replyText: "I\u2019ve been thinking\u2026 I read in one of the old books that
      there\u2019s something called an Oasis Generator. Apparently, it can turn barren
      land into fertile farmland. If it\u2019s not just a legend\u2026"

      it\u2019s just a legend?"
    replyText: "Maybe\u2026 but without extra food, we won\u2019t last long here.
      We can hunt, but it\u2019s only enough for a short time. It\u2019s worth trying
      to look for this generator \u2013 it could be our only chance."
