  - optionText: How did this village come to be?
    replyText: The village was founded in 2110 on the site of a survivor camp built
      by soldiers. All the zombies who were here helped build it. Nothing has changed
      since 2110.

  - optionText: Are there any non-zombies living in the village?
    replyText: No, this village is only for zombies who survived Little Rock. Basically,
      everyone who made it ended up a zombie. There was no chance to avoid it - the
      bomb hit the city center directly.

    replyText: "Not really. There\u2019s just my house, Private Ryan\u2019s house,
      a zombie dormitory and the cafeteria. As you can see - nothing exciting."

    replyText: "No, there\u2019s still terrible radiation there. Many soldiers never
      came back from that place, so we put up sheet metal fences near the skyscrapers."

    replyText: "Actually\u2026 yes. Strange noises have been coming from the old
      supermarket east of the village for a few days. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s
      people or some kind of mutated creatures, but it could be a threat to the village.
      Could you go there and check it out?"

    replyText: "Good job. I was afraid it was something more serious, but since it
      was just rats, it\u2019s great you got rid of them. The whole village can sleep
      easier. Here\u2019s your reward \u2013 250 dollars, you\u2019ve earned it"
